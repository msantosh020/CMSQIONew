CUL_PERF_MSR_LRN_DESC=<p>1. Understand examples that highlight the difference that ongoing measurement can make.</p><p>2. Identify types of data to capture and track.</p>
CUL_PERF_MSR_KEY_DESC=<p>1. Very often there is data that you can have at your fingertips that people are not thinking of as data.</p><p>2. It is helpful to identify a strong link between the process you are measuring and the outcome you are hoping to achieve, especially when you cannotmeasure the outcome directly in a timely way.</p>

COM_KEY_DEC_MKR_KEY_DESC=<p>1. Attention is a precursor to action. There is a demand to be skilled at securing attention.</p><p>2. In an attention economy, exceptional companies and organizations will be determined by how well they can curates and target that information to direct the attention of audiences and make the best use of that attention.</p><p>3. Attention is related to trust.</p><p>4. Curate with precision and clarity with perspective taking (CPCP).</p>


DAT_SAN_LRN_DESC=<p>1. Understand the benefits of process-oriented thinking as a foundation for any improvement approach.</p><p>2. Distinguish between common and special causes of variation and the different strategies for dealing with each.</p><p>3. Learn a common use strategy that can be applied to your work at the QIN-QIO.</p>
DAT_SAN_KEY_DESC=<p>1. <strong><em>Everything</em></strong> is a process, which is the basis of any improvement approach – TQM, CQI, Six Sigma, Lean, Lean Six Sigma, Toyota Production System: <em>they’re basically all the same!</em></p><p>2. Even if things “shouldn’t” happen, you could be “perfectly designed” to have them happen – which requires <em>a totally different approach</em> that could actually <strong><em>solve</em></strong> the problem</p><p>3. It’s not about the obvious problems that march into your office – the most important problems are the ones<em> of which no one is aware.</em></p><p>4. Most of what people are taught in a “basic statistics” course is worthless because of the presence of undesirable, uncontrollable variation in an    <em>everyday</em> environment, which <em>invalidates</em> many techniques</p><p>5.This webinar’s approach to statistics (“analytic”) deals specifically with this everyday variation to expose this undesirable variation and then reduce the inappropriate and unintended variation, <em>which makes processes more predictable</em></p><p>6.The ability to distinguish between common causes of variation and special causes of variation is crucial<em></em></p><p>7.A key tool is plotting process performance over time, known as a <strong>run chart</strong></p><p>8. Given a “vague” problem, one should first plot process performance in a run chart and then apply the Pareto Principle to answer the question – “What is the 20 percent of this process that is causing 80 percent of the problem?”</p><p>9. Most bar graph, trend line, traffic light, and variance-to-goal reports unwittingly cause major damage and waste precious time and energy – the alternative mindset of this webinar <em>will create the time</em> to do <em>effective</em> improvement work</p>

LRN_ACT_NTW_LRN_DESC=<p>Demonstrate best practices to make virtual and in-person meetings more effective.</p>
LRN_ACT_NTW_KEY_DESC=<p>1. The three types of webinars include broadcast, breakout, and problem solving, and all have specific benefits and purposes.</p><p>2. There are strategies and tactics that lend to effective webinars, including the use of web cameras by speakers and the facilitator being update and organized.</p>


PAT_FMLY_ENG_LRN_DESC=<p>1. Define “Patient &amp; family engagement”.</p><p>2. Understand how to deploy patient and family engagement improvement.</p><p>3. Learn different methods for engaging patients in quality improvement.</p>
PAT_FMLY_ENG_KEY_DESC=<p>1. Patient and family engagement is a strategy for improvement, not a lofty goal.</p><p>2. In care, it’s not about getting patients to comply or change behavior.</p><p>3. In quality improvement, patient can help if we let them.</p>

SETGN_STG_SUC_LRN_DESC=<p>1. Be able to describe the early accomplishments of the QIO Program in the 11th SOW.</p><p>2. Feel prepared to recruit providers and partners to register for and participate in the August National LAN Call with the promotional packages developed by the QIN NCC.</p>
SETGN_STG_SUC_KEY_DESC=<p>1. July 30, 2015 marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since 1965, these programs have been promoting, providing andprotecting the health and well-being of millions of American families.</p><p>2. Going forward, the National LAN Calls will be open to QIN-QIOs, providers, partners, and patients. Registration will also be required.</p><p>3. The CMS healthcare delivery system reform work endeavors to reward value and care coordination over volume and duplication.</p><p>4. As CMS proposes new work and expanded resources for CMMI test models and the QIO program, it will be critically important for QIOs to be in closerworking partnerships with influential partners: HENs (hospital associations &amp; systems), PTNs and SANs (medical societies, clinician leadershiporganizations, others), Regional Health Collaboratives, RECs and others.</p><p>5. Position QIN-QIOs as natural health system integrators -- with ties to all the key provider organization types (hospitals, clinical practices, long-termcare organizations, home health and others).</p>

Recognize your organization’s impact on health care by participating with the QIO program, and create a story that translates this impact for your customers.</p><p>3. Clearly understand how you can share your improvement story with your local QIN-QIO by September 1, 2015, and be highlighted on a future National LAN Call.</p>
QIO_PGM_NAT_BNF_LSUP_KEY_DESC=<p>National Quality Strategy Goals include:</p><p>• Make care safer</p><p>• Strengthen person and family engagement</p><p>• Promote effective communication and coordination of care</p><p>• Promote effective prevention and treatment</p><p>• Promote best practices for healthy living</p><p>• Make care affordable</p>

Evidence reveals that patients who are actively involved in their health and healthcare:</p><p>• Achieve better clinical outcomes.</p><p>• Have lower healthcare costs.</p><p>• Are more satisfied with their care experience.</p>


UNL_PWR_DAT_LRN_DESC=<p>1. Describe key elements to help you succeed in the data-driven health care landscape.</p><p>2. Identify examples of available data from your QIN-QIO and other sources of data that you can use now.</p><p>3.

UNL_PWR_DAT_KEY_DESC=<p>1. Root cause analysis (RCA) and data collection are integral to identifying the opportunities to improve the systems of care coordination.</p><p>2. Interventions to improve the system must be based upon the RCA findings in order to demonstrate the desired impact and improvement.</p><p>3. Interventions must be measured to determine success &amp; progress over time.</p><p>4. Reporting outcomes is replacing reporting processes of care because:</p><p>· Outcome measurement and risk adjustment have improved.</p><p>· Process performance has improved so that it is more an internal concern.</p>
